    "rawMsg": "If you are anything like me, you really appreciate a good mac and cheese. I used to make it with a roux-based sauce, which was decent, but not great. It had decent texture, but the flavor was lacking and I always wanted to have something else to serve alongside it. Enter [[ab]]. This one's a game-changer, folks. It's so good, and so easy that I've enshrined the recipe on a post-it right in the middle of my kitchen cabinets, where it'll stay until I've commited it to memory thanks to rote repitition.",
