  <h1>Mac And Cheese: Quick and Easy</h1>
  <p>If you are anything like me, you really appreciate a good mac and cheese. I used to make it with a roux-based sauce, which was decent, but not great. It had decent texture, but the flavor was lacking and I always wanted to have something else to serve
    alongside it. Enter
    <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/stovetop-mac-n-cheese-recipe-1939465">Alton Brown</a>. This one's a game-changer, folks. It's so good, and so easy that I've enshrined the recipe on a post-it right in the middle of my kitchen cabinets, where it'll stay until I've commited it to memory thanks to rote repitition.</p>

    <h2>The Base Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound noodles, cooked al dente</li>
      <li>4 Tablespoons butter, unsalted</li>
      <li>6 ounces evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
      <li>10 ounces cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Return noodles to their pot, and melt butter into them over low heat. In a measuring cup, mix milk/eggs/salt/mustard together. Pour mixture over butter-coated noodles, and stir together. Gradually add cheese and stir over low heat until it's all melted,
      ~3 minutes. Portion into bowls and top with pepper as desired. Makes 3-4 servings as a side, or 2 as a standalone meal.</p>
